PROJECT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT
LLM Development Ecosystem - Integration and Completion

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
A comprehensive LLM development ecosystem combining high-performance C++ inference (gemma.cpp), Python-based AI agent framework with RAG capabilities, and Rust-powered system tools. The project requires completing builds, fixing integration issues, and optimizing performance across Windows native, WSL, and cross-platform targets.

TECHNICAL STACK:
- C++ (Gemma inference engine with SIMD optimizations)
- Python (AI agent framework with tool registry)
- Rust (RAG-Redis system with vector search)
- Redis (Vector database and memory tiers)
- MCP Protocol (Inter-process communication)

CURRENT STATE:
- C++ Gemma build incomplete (missing gemma.exe)
- Python agent framework functional but disconnected from native inference
- RAG-Redis system reorganized but not built (90% completion before resource failure)
- MCP servers configured but not integrated
- VFS errors from stale build artifacts (10GB+ cleaned)

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:
1. Complete all component builds within resource constraints
2. Fix integration between C++/Python/Rust components
3. Establish working MCP protocol communication
4. Enable full AI agent pipeline with RAG support
5. Optimize for memory-constrained environment

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:

Build System Requirements:
- Fix CMake configuration using VS 2022 bundled version
- Complete C++ Gemma build with gemma.exe, benchmarks, and migration tools
- Build Rust RAG-Redis system with memory-optimized settings
- Compile Python-Rust extensions via maturin
- Clean stale build artifacts to free resources

Integration Requirements:
- Connect Python agent to native Gemma executable
- Wire up MCP protocol between Python and Rust components
- Implement Redis connection for RAG vector search
- Enable cross-language memory sharing
- Fix hardcoded Windows paths for cross-platform compatibility

AI/ML Pipeline Requirements:
- Load Gemma models from .models/ directory (2B and 4B variants)
- Support three agent modes: FULL (PyTorch), LIGHTWEIGHT (Pipeline), NATIVE (C++)
- Implement 5-tier memory system (Working → Short-term → Long-term → Episodic → Semantic)
- Enable SIMD optimizations for vector operations
- Add fallback mechanisms for resource constraints

Performance Requirements:
- Achieve <2 second model loading time
- Enable batch inference for throughput
- Implement request queuing and async processing
- Add caching layers for frequent queries
- Support model quantization for memory efficiency

Testing Requirements:
- Validate each component build independently
- Test integration points between languages
- Verify MCP protocol communication
- Benchmark inference performance
- Test memory tier transitions

NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Maintain 85% code coverage
- Support Windows, WSL, Linux, macOS
- Handle resource constraints gracefully
- Provide clear error messages and fallbacks
- Document all integration points

CONSTRAINTS:
- Memory limitations (builds failing at 90% completion)
- Disk space available: 2.0TB
- Model sizes: 2-7GB per model
- Must use existing tools in C:\users\david\.local\bin\

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
1. All three language components build successfully
2. End-to-end AI agent query works with RAG
3. MCP servers respond to protocol requests
4. Memory usage stays within available limits
5. Performance meets or exceeds baseline metrics

DELIVERABLES:
1. Working gemma.exe with benchmark tools
2. Built RAG-Redis binaries and Python extensions
3. Integrated Python agent with native inference
4. Functional MCP server communication
5. Complete documentation of integration points
6. Test suite validating all components

TECHNICAL DEBT TO ADDRESS:
- Replace subprocess calls with proper FFI
- Remove hardcoded paths throughout codebase
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Add configuration management system
- Create service discovery mechanism

RISK MITIGATION:
- Use single-threaded builds to avoid memory pressure
- Implement progressive build strategy
- Add multiple fallback mechanisms
- Create minimal working configurations
- Monitor resource usage during builds

TIMELINE PRIORITIES:
Phase 1 (Immediate): Fix builds and basic integration
Phase 2 (Short-term): Wire up MCP and Redis
Phase 3 (Medium-term): Optimize performance and memory
Phase 4 (Long-term): Refactor architecture and add production features
