## Coverage Distribution Analysis

| Coverage Range | Module Count | Percentage |
|----------------|-------------|------------|
| 0% | 67 modules | 85.9% |
| 1-25% | 3 modules | 3.8% |
| 26-50% | 2 modules | 2.6% |

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Zero Coverage in Core Systems
- **All CLI modules** have 0% coverage - prevents testing of user-facing functionality
- **All Infrastructure modules** have 0% coverage - no testing of core backend services
- **Most Agent modules** have 0% coverage - no testing of AI agent functionality

### 2. Import/Dependency Issues
- Import errors in `test_gcp_integration.py` preventing full test suite execution
- Relative import issues in `src/gcp/gemma_download.py`

### 3. Test Infrastructure Problems
- Coverage goal of 85% is far from current 6.03% (gap of 78.97%)
- Most test files appear to be fixtures/validation rather than comprehensive unit/integration tests

## Immediate Action Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Critical Infrastructure (Priority 1)
1. **Resolve import errors** in test files
2. **Add unit tests for CLI modules** (`cli/main.py`, `cli/chat.py`, `cli/config.py`)
3. **Add tests for agent core functionality** (`agent/core.py`, `agent/gemma_agent.py`)

### Phase 2: Cover Infrastructure Layer (Priority 2)
1. **Add MCP server/client tests** (`infrastructure/mcp/`)
2. **Add LLM integration tests** (`infrastructure/llm/`)
3. **Add sandbox/tools tests** (`infrastructure/sandbox/`, `infrastructure/tools/`)

### Phase 3: Improve Shared Components (Priority 3)
1. **Boost logging module coverage** (currently 29-33%)
2. **Improve config module coverage** (currently 54-68%)
3. **Add comprehensive integration tests**

## Recommendations

### Testing Strategy
1. **Start with unit tests** for individual functions/classes
2. **Use mocking extensively** for external dependencies
3. **Focus on business logic first** before I/O operations
4. **Add integration tests** for critical user workflows

### Coverage Targets by Module Type
- **CLI modules**: Target 90%+ (user-facing, high reliability needed)
- **Agent modules**: Target 85%+ (core business logic)
- **Infrastructure**: Target 80%+ (integration points)
- **Shared/Config**: Target 95%+ (foundation layer)

### Quick Wins (Easiest to improve)
1. **shared/config modules** - Already have some coverage, can be boosted
2. **agent/core.py** - Has 19% coverage, build upon existing tests
3. **Simple CLI commands** - Start with basic argument parsing tests

## Tools and Commands for Implementation

```bash
# Run coverage for specific module
uv run pytest tests/unit/test_agent_core.py --cov=src.agent.core --cov-report=term-missing

# Generate coverage HTML report
uv run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Focus on critical modules
uv run pytest --cov=src.cli --cov=src.agent --cov=src.infrastructure --cov-report=term

# Check for import issues
uv run python -c "import src.cli.main; print('CLI imports OK')"
```

## Conclusion

The current 6.03% coverage represents a **slight decrease** from the reported 6.24% baseline. To reach the 85% target, we need to add comprehensive test coverage for **67 modules currently at 0%**.

**Priority focus should be on CLI and Agent modules** as these represent the core user-facing and business logic functionality of the system.
