# Security Implementation Report - Gemma LLM Project

## Executive Summary

All critical security vulnerabilities have been successfully addressed with comprehensive fixes implemented across the application stack. The implementation follows OWASP best practices and provides defense-in-depth security.

## Security Fixes Implemented

### 1. ✅ API Authentication Enhancement (CRITICAL - FIXED)

**Previous Issue:** API endpoints exposed without authentication when `api_key_required=False`

**Solution Implemented:**
- **File:** `src/shared/config/settings.py`
- Enforced mandatory API key validation in production
- Added environment-based API key loading
- Implemented secure key hashing with SHA-256
- Added production mode validation that prevents disabling authentication

**Key Features:**
- API keys must be at least 32 characters
- Keys are stored as hashes for security
- Automatic temporary key generation in development mode
- Environment variable support (`GEMMA_API_KEYS`)

### 2. ✅ CORS Policy Restriction (HIGH - FIXED)

**Previous Issue:** CORS allowed all origins (`["*"]`)

**Solution Implemented:**
- **File:** `src/shared/config/settings.py`
- Restricted CORS to specific origins: `["http://localhost:3000", "http://localhost:8000"]`
- Added validation warning for wildcard usage
- Production mode enforces strict origin policies

**Security Headers Added:**
- Content-Security-Policy with strict directives
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

### 3. ✅ Input Sanitization & Prompt Injection Prevention (HIGH - FIXED)

**Previous Issue:** No protection against prompt injection attacks

**Solution Implemented:**
- **New File:** `src/domain/validators.py`
- Comprehensive prompt validation system
- Detection of 20+ injection patterns
- Sensitive data redaction (API keys, credit cards, SSNs)
- Harmful content filtering
- Risk scoring system (0.0 to 1.0)

**Protection Against:**
- Direct instruction overrides
- Role manipulation attempts
- Data extraction attempts
- Command injection
- Sensitive data exposure
- Harmful content generation

### 4. ✅ Enhanced Authentication Middleware (MEDIUM - FIXED)

**Previous Issue:** Weak API key validation accepting any key > 32 characters

**Solution Implemented:**
- **File:** `src/server/middleware.py`
- Proper API key validation against configured keys
- Secure key storage using SHA-256 hashing
- Bearer token authentication scheme
- Request state user tracking
- Comprehensive error handling

### 5. ✅ Request Validation Middleware (NEW)

**New Features Added:**
- **File:** `src/server/middleware.py` (InputValidationMiddleware)
- Content-Type validation
- Request size limits (configurable, default 10MB)
- Header injection prevention
- Automatic prompt sanitization
- Request body validation

### 6. ✅ Security Headers Middleware (NEW)

**New File:** `src/server/security_headers.py`

**Headers Implemented:**
- Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
- X-Content-Type-Options
- X-Frame-Options
- X-XSS-Protection
- Referrer-Policy
- Permissions-Policy
- Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)

## Configuration Updates

### Security Configuration (`SecurityConfig`)

```python
class SecurityConfig(BaseModel):
    max_request_size_mb: int = 10
    rate_limit_per_minute: int = 60
    allowed_origins: list[str] = ["http://localhost:3000", "http://localhost:8000"]
    api_key_required: bool = True  # ALWAYS True in production
    api_keys: list[str] = []
    enable_rate_limiting: bool = True
    max_prompt_length: int = 4096
    block_sensitive_patterns: bool = True
    enable_request_validation: bool = True
    jwt_secret: str | None = None
    jwt_algorithm: str = "HS256"
    jwt_expiry_hours: int = 24
```

## Middleware Stack Order

The middleware is applied in the following order (critical for security):

1. CORS Middleware
2. Security Headers Middleware
3. Trusted Host Middleware
4. Authentication Middleware
5. Rate Limiting Middleware
6. Input Validation Middleware
7. Logging Middleware
8. Metrics Middleware

## Testing & Verification

A comprehensive test suite has been created in `test_security.py` that validates:

1. **Prompt Validation**
   - Injection pattern detection
   - Sensitive data redaction
   - Harmful content filtering
   - Risk scoring accuracy

2. **API Key Validation**
   - Key generation
   - Secure hashing
   - Validation logic

3. **Request Validation**
   - Content-Type checking
   - Size limit enforcement
   - Header validation

4. **Security Configuration**
   - Production mode enforcement
   - CORS configuration
   - Environment variable loading

## Deployment Recommendations

### Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables in production:

```bash
# API Keys (comma-separated)
GEMMA_API_KEYS=your-secure-api-key-1,your-secure-api-key-2

# Environment
GEMMA_ENVIRONMENT=production

# JWT Secret (for future token-based auth)
GEMMA_SECURITY_JWT_SECRET=your-256-bit-secret

# Allowed Origins (comma-separated)
GEMMA_SECURITY_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com,https://api.yourdomain.com
```

### Production Checklist

- [ ] Set `GEMMA_ENVIRONMENT=production`
- [ ] Configure valid API keys in `GEMMA_API_KEYS`
- [ ] Update `allowed_origins` with production domains
- [ ] Enable HTTPS and configure SSL certificates
- [ ] Set up rate limiting appropriate for your infrastructure
- [ ] Configure logging to external service
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting for security events
- [ ] Regular security audits and dependency updates

## Security Best Practices

1. **API Key Management**
   - Rotate API keys every 90 days
   - Use different keys for different environments
   - Never commit keys to version control
   - Monitor key usage for anomalies

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Adjust limits based on legitimate usage patterns
   - Implement user-specific rate limits
   - Add IP-based blocking for repeated violations

3. **Monitoring**
   - Track failed authentication attempts
   - Monitor for injection patterns
   - Alert on high risk scores
   - Review security logs regularly

4. **Updates**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Review OWASP Top 10 annually
   - Conduct regular security audits
   - Perform penetration testing

## Conclusion

All identified security vulnerabilities have been successfully remediated with comprehensive fixes that follow security best practices. The application now implements defense-in-depth security with multiple layers of protection including:

- Strong authentication
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure CORS configuration
- Rate limiting
- Security headers
