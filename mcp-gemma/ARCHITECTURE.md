# MCP-Gemma Refactored Architecture

## Overview

The MCP-Gemma codebase has been refactored to follow SOLID principles and eliminate GOD objects. The new architecture emphasizes separation of concerns, dependency injection, and clean interfaces.

## Key Architectural Improvements

### 1. **Elimination of GOD Objects**

Previously, the `GemmaServer` class in `base.py` had too many responsibilities:
- Configuration management
- Logging setup
- Redis connection
- Metrics tracking
- MCP handlers
- Model management

This has been split into focused, single-responsibility services.

### 2. **SOLID Principles Applied**

#### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Each class now has exactly one reason to change:
- `Configuration`: Manages configuration only
- `ModelService`: Handles model operations only
- `GenerationService`: Manages text generation only
- `MemoryService`: Handles memory operations only
- `MetricsService`: Tracks metrics only

#### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
The system is open for extension but closed for modification:
- New handlers can be added without modifying existing code
- New transport strategies can be added without changing the server
- New memory backends can be added via the repository pattern

#### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
All implementations can be substituted for their interfaces:
- Any `ITransport` implementation works with the server
- Any `IMemoryRepository` implementation works with `MemoryService`
- Any `IRequestHandler` works in the handler chain

#### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Clients depend only on the interfaces they use:
- `IGenerationClient` for generation operations
- `IModelClient` for model management
- `IMemoryClient` for memory operations
- `IMetricsClient` for metrics

#### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules:
- Server depends on service interfaces, not implementations
- Services depend on repository interfaces, not concrete repositories
- Clients depend on transport interfaces, not specific transports

### 3. **Design Patterns Implemented**

#### Strategy Pattern
Used for transport layer - different transport strategies can be swapped:
```python
# All these are interchangeable
transport = StdioTransportStrategy(server)
transport = HTTPTransportStrategy(server, host, port)
transport = WebSocketTransportStrategy(server, host, port)
```

#### Factory Pattern
Used for object creation to encapsulate complexity:
```python
# Server creation
server = ServerFactory.create_from_config(config)

# Client creation
client = ClientFactory.create_http_client(url)
```

#### Builder Pattern
Used for complex configuration:
```python
config = ConfigurationBuilder()
    .with_model(path, tokenizer)
    .with_generation_params(max_tokens=2048)
    .with_memory_backend("redis", host="localhost")
    .build()
```

#### Repository Pattern
Separates data access from business logic:
```python
# Different repositories, same interface
repository = RedisMemoryRepository(redis_client)
repository = InMemoryRepository()
repository = FileModelRepository()
```

#### Chain of Responsibility Pattern
Request handlers form a chain:
```python
handlers = [
    GenerationHandler(generation_service),
    ModelHandler(model_service),
    MemoryHandler(memory_service),
    MetricsHandler(metrics_service)
]
```

#### Observer Pattern
For event notifications:
```python
model_service.add_observer(metrics_service)
# Metrics are automatically updated when model switches
```

#### Adapter Pattern
Transport adapters convert different protocols to a common interface:
```python
adapter = HTTPAdapter(url)
adapter = WebSocketAdapter(url)
adapter = StdioAdapter()
# All have the same interface
```

#### Composite Pattern
Provides convenience without forcing all interfaces:
```python
# Use composite for all features
client = CompositeClient(transport)

# Or use individual clients
gen_client = GenerationClient(transport)
model_client = ModelClient(transport)
```

## Architecture Layers

### 1. **Core Layer** (`server/core/`)
Contains the business logic and domain models:
- `contracts.py`: Interface definitions (ISP)
- `config.py`: Configuration management (SRP)
- `services.py`: Business services (SRP)
- `repositories.py`: Data access layer (Repository Pattern)
- `handlers.py`: Request handlers (Chain of Responsibility)
- `server.py`: Server coordination (SRP)
- `factory.py`: Object creation (Factory Pattern)

### 2. **Transport Layer** (`server/transports.py`)
Implements different communication protocols:
- `TransportStrategy`: Base strategy class
- `StdioTransportStrategy`: Command-line interface
- `HTTPTransportStrategy`: REST API
- `WebSocketTransportStrategy`: Real-time communication
- `CompositeTransport`: Multiple transports simultaneously

### 3. **Client Layer** (`client/core/`)
Provides client-side abstractions:
- `contracts.py`: Client interfaces (ISP)
- `clients.py`: Specialized clients (SRP)
- `composite.py`: Combined client (Composite Pattern)
- `factory.py`: Client creation (Factory Pattern)

### 4. **Transport Adapters** (`client/transport_adapters.py`)
Adapts different transports to a common interface:
- `HTTPAdapter`: HTTP/REST communication
- `WebSocketAdapter`: WebSocket communication
- `StdioAdapter`: Command-line communication

## Dependency Flow

```
Application (main.py)
    ↓
ConfigurationBuilder → Configuration
    ↓
ServerFactory
    ↓
MCPServer ← Services (Model, Generation, Memory, Metrics)
    ↑            ↓
Handlers ← Repositories (Model, Memory)
    ↑
Transport Strategies
```

## Benefits of the Refactored Architecture

### 1. **Maintainability**
- Each component has a clear, single responsibility
- Changes to one component don't cascade to others
- Easy to understand and reason about

### 2. **Testability**
- Components can be tested in isolation
- Mock implementations can be easily created
- Dependencies are injected, not hardcoded

### 3. **Extensibility**
- New features can be added without modifying existing code
- New transports, repositories, or handlers plug in easily
- Different implementations can be swapped via interfaces

### 4. **Reusability**
- Services can be reused in different contexts
- Clients can choose exactly what they need
- Transport adapters work with any server implementation

### 5. **Flexibility**
- Multiple deployment options (stdio, HTTP, WebSocket)
- Multiple memory backends (Redis, in-memory)
- Clients can use composite or individual interfaces

## Usage Examples

### Server Usage

```python
# Build configuration
config = ConfigurationBuilder()
    .with_model("/path/to/model.sbs")
    .with_generation_params(max_tokens=2048, temperature=0.7)
    .with_memory_backend("redis")
    .with_metrics(enabled=True)
    .build()

# Create server
server = ServerFactory.create_from_config(config)
await server.initialize()

# Create and start transport
transport = HTTPTransportStrategy(server, "localhost", 8080)
await transport.start()
```

### Client Usage

```python
# Option 1: Composite client (all features)
client = ClientFactory.create_http_client("http://localhost:8080")
async with client:
    response = await client.simple_generate("Hello, world!")
    metrics = await client.get_metrics()

# Option 2: Specialized clients (only what you need)
transport = HTTPAdapter("http://localhost:8080")
gen_client = GenerationClient(transport)
await transport.connect()
response = await gen_client.generate(GenerationRequest("Hello!"))

# Option 3: Builder pattern
client = ClientBuilder()
    .with_http("http://localhost:8080")
    .with_timeout(60.0)
    .with_debug(True)
    .as_composite()
    .build()
```

## Migration Guide

### For Server Code

Old way:
```python
server = GemmaServer(config)
# Everything was in one class
```

New way:
```python
server = ServerFactory.create_from_config(config)
# Responsibilities are separated
```

### For Client Code

Old way:
```python
client = BaseGemmaClient()
# Client had all responsibilities
```

New way:
```python
# Choose what you need
client = CompositeClient(transport)  # All features
# OR
client = GenerationClient(transport)  # Just generation
```

## Conclusion

The refactored architecture successfully eliminates GOD objects and applies SOLID principles throughout the codebase. The result is a more maintainable, testable, and extensible system that maintains backward compatibility while providing a cleaner foundation for future development.
