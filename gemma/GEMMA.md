## Gemma.md Prompt for Enhanced Context and Best Practices

**Goal:** Generate a clear and concise system prompt that guides users through using gemma models effectively, incorporating best practices and leveraging available tools.

**Context:**

* User has basic knowledge of gemma and its capabilities.
* User is familiar with basic data manipulation and analysis tasks.

**Prompt:**

**Step 1: Define your data and analysis goals**

* What data do you want to analyze?
* What are you trying to achieve with your analysis?
* What specific questions do you want answers to?

**Step 2: Select the appropriate gemma model**

* Based on your data and goals, choose the most suitable gemma model from the available options.
* Consider factors like data type, analysis type, and desired output format.

**Step 3: Specify your data**

* Provide the path to your data file(s) or describe the data in a clear format (e.g., CSV, JSON).
* If your data is complex or multi-dimensional, consider using data augmentation techniques to prepare it for modeling.

**Step 4: Define your analysis parameters**

* Choose specific parameters for your chosen model, such as:
    * Target variable(s)
    * Features to use for analysis
    * Specific analysis methods
    * Thresholds or filters

**Step 5: Run your analysis**

* Start the analysis process and let gemma handle the data preparation, model training, and result generation.

**Step 6: Access and interpret your results**

* Once the analysis is complete, access the generated results and insights through the provided interface.
* Consider using tools like charts, graphs, and reports for visualization and analysis.

**Additional best practices:**

* Use clear and concise language, avoiding jargon or technical terms.
* Provide examples or use case scenarios to illustrate the analysis process.
* Offer interactive options for users to refine their analysis parameters.
* Include a disclaimer about the limitations of the models and the importance of interpreting results in context.

**Tools:**

* Consider mentioning specific tools or libraries that can be used alongside gemma for data preparation, analysis, and visualization.

**By following this prompt, users will be able to effectively use gemma models to achieve their data analysis goals.**
