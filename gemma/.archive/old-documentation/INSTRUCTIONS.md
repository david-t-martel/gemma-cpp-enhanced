# Gemma C++ Framework: Instructions for Code Generation and Review

This document provides instructions on how to use the Gemma C++ framework for code generation and review. It is intended for both human and LLM agent users.

## Overview

The Gemma C++ framework consists of two main components:

*   **A C++ library:** This library provides a lightweight and efficient implementation of the Gemma model.
*   **A Python CLI:** This command-line interface provides a user-friendly way to interact with the C++ library.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   A C++17 compiler (e.g., Clang, GCC, MSVC)
*   CMake 3.10 or later
*   Python 3.7 or later

### Building the C++ Library

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/google/gemma.cpp.git
    ```

2.  Create a build directory:

    ```bash
    cd gemma.cpp
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```

3.  Configure the build with CMake:

    ```bash
    cmake ..
    ```

4.  Build the library:

    ```bash
    make
    ```

### Using the Python CLI

The Python CLI provides a convenient way to interact with the Gemma C++ library. To use it, simply run the `gemma-cli.py` script:

```bash
python gemma-cli.py --model <path_to_model> --tokenizer <path_to_tokenizer>
```

For more information on the available command-line options, see the `GEMMA_CLI_USAGE.md` file.

## Code Generation

The Gemma C++ framework can be used to generate code in a variety of programming languages. To generate code, simply provide a prompt to the Python CLI. For example, to generate a Python function that calculates the factorial of a number, you could use the following prompt:

```
Write a Python function that calculates the factorial of a number.
```

The Gemma model will then generate the corresponding Python code.

## Code Review

The Gemma C++ framework can also be used to review code. To review a piece of code, simply provide it to the Python CLI as part of a prompt. For example, to review a Python function, you could use the following prompt:

```
Review the following Python function:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
```
```

The Gemma model will then provide feedback on the code, such as identifying potential bugs, suggesting improvements, and checking for style violations.

## Advanced Usage

The Gemma C++ framework provides a number of advanced features for code generation and review. For more information, please refer to the documentation in the `docs` directory.
