**Available Commands:**
```bash
# From auto-claude framework
npm run fix:auto-claude          # Auto-fix common issues
npm run lint:auto-claude         # Analyze code quality
npm run code-quality             # Comprehensive quality check

# From project
./setup-precommit.sh             # Setup pre-commit hooks
./fix-code-quality.sh            # Quick quality fixes
./run-quality-check.sh           # Full validation
pre-commit run --all-files       # Manual pre-commit run
```
