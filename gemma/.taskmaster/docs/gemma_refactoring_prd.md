# Gemma.cpp Comprehensive Refactoring PRD

## Executive Summary
Transform the Gemma.cpp project into a production-ready, hardware-accelerated LLM inference engine with session management, persistence, and multiple interface options for Windows and WSL environments.

## Project Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. Refactor codebase into clean, modular architecture
2. Implement multi-backend hardware acceleration (Intel oneAPI, OpenVINO, NVIDIA CUDA)
3. Add session management with conversation persistence
4. Create multiple interfaces (CLI, MCP server, REST API)
5. Optimize for Windows with WSL compatibility
6. Establish CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

## Technical Requirements

### Core Architecture Refactoring
- Reorganize project structure with clear separation of concerns
